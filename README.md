# HDBRTS_Management_System
### Introduction
HDBRTS is a bus transit system which is the first BRTS branch in Karnataka named "Chigari". 
This system is located between the cities Hubli-Dharwad to help passengers to travel between the cities. 
In this system there will be different types of buses like 200,201&100 where types have their implicit meaning and there is the capacity for the buses up to which it can take the passengers in. 
There are predefined stops between the cities to where passengers can travel through. 
There will be different types of passengers like passengers who have student bus pass, monthly bus pass or general passengers who are passengers. 
Passengers will be charged based on category for the ticket. There are different employees working for this system. 
The HDBRTS is even has an event called GreenBRTS where in which they plant a tree in twin cities every year due to the reduced number of plants in road widening between the cities.
Record of these events has to be maintained and can be manipulated whenever required. There is a need for such an application to maintain and manage the whole. 
The admins as a front end of the branch will manage the specific operations. Certain features of the system are also provided to use by the passenger being the user of the system.
